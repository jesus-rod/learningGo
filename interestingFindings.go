package main

//array initialization
//variables not used cause compilation error
//short variable names? idk why
// Public methods WriteToDB // exported
// internal writeToDB (unexported and only visible within the package)
//The benefit of doing it this way over using keywords to define exportedness (extern, public, etc.) is that making it a part of the name ensures that anywhere an identifier is used you can tell if it is exported or not without having to find where it was defined (to see if the definition contains a keyword).
// go formatter
// go dependencies automatic adding

// Go mod to make GoLand work
